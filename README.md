# ML01_Regression_ANN
Machine Learning Project to solve a Regression problem using Artificial Neural Network in Python.

We have a dataset containing the Car purchase amount in a csv format. We'd do perform regression to predict Car Purchase Amount based on the inpute features like Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt and Networth.

We'll needing below libraries to perform the Training

Pandas For Data Analysis
Numpy for Numerical Analysis
Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization
Sklearn, Tensorflow and Keras for Training and Validation


Steps:

## 1) Import Libraries

## 2) Read and Explore the dataset using Pandas

## 3) Visualise Data

## 4) Decide on Input features and perform Data cleaning

## 5) Normalize the Data using MinMaxScaler

## 6) Split the dataset into Training & Testing Set

## 7) Create Neural Network Layer using the Neurons in a Sequential fashion

## 8) Train the model again and again using different set of parameters, epochs, Neurons, Activation Function

## 9) Evaluate the Model on the test set

## 10) Predict using a given input criteria
